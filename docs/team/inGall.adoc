==== Justification
For the `birthday` command, tt allows users to store and keep track of their contacts' birthday so that they can
be reminded of upcoming birthdays. This enhances relations between individuals.

For the different find commands, it allows users to traverse through the lists and find contacts and reminders easily. +

For  `findPhone` and `findEmail` command, it is very handy when the user receives a call or email from an unknown person.
The user can use the number or email to search through the contact list using these commands to see if it belongs to any
one of his or her contact. +

Similarly, the user can use `findReminder` and `findPriority` command to search for reminders that he wants at any moment.

For the different sort commands, it offers more ways for users to look at the list. +

For example, `sort` command allows users to view the list in alphabetical order so that users can search for their
contacts easily. +

The `sortBirthday` command enables users to view the list in the order of birthday,
allowing them to view upcoming birthday in a glance without searching through the entire list. +

The `sortAge` command allows users to view contacts by the order of their age, offering them a
new perspective of their contact list. +

On the other hand, `sortPriority` allows users to rearrange the list and view reminders
that have a high priority at the top.

For the `listReminder` command, it allows users to see all the reminders at a time after they are done searching for specific reminders. +
For example, a user may search for a specific reminder. It will bring them to the screen with only the reminder. To
bring them back to the list of all reminders, the `listReminder` command is needed.
