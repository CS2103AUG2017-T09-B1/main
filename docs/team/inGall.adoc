== Project: Gentleman's Guide
Gentleman's Guide is a desktop address book application modified from the Address Book - Level 4 to store person contacts and reminders. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/inGall.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/inGall.md[Test code]]

*Purpose of portfolio*: This portfolio is written to reflect the contributions made by the author to the Gentleman's Guide.
It shows how all the features implemented by the author work.

=== Enhancement Added : Birthday Feature
==== External Behaviour
===== Modifying birthday to person: `birthday`

Adds / Edits / Removes a birthday parameter to an existing person in the address book. +
Format: `birthday INDEX [b/dd/mm/yyyy]`

****
* Add / Edits / Removes birthday parameter to the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* For adding / editing : Format must be of " `dd/mm/yyyy` " including the " `/` "
* For removing : input nothing after " `b/` "
****

Examples:

* `birthday 1 b/20/07/1995` +
Adds / changes birthday of the 1st person to be `20/07/1995`
* `birthday 3 b/` +
Removes the birthday of the 3rd person.

==== Justification
It allows users to store and keep track of their contacts' birthday so that they can be reminded of upcoming birthdays.
This enhances relations between individuals.

==== Implementation
=====  Modifying birthday to person: `birthday`

`BirthdayCommand` : It allows the adding, editing and removing of birthday parameter to/from a person. +


The `BirthdayCommand` lies in the `commands` of `Logic`. and does not deal with `UndoableCommands`, thus the actions cannot be reversed.  The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

_Figure 4.3.1.1a : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component.

The user will not be able to enter the birthday parameter when adding contacts. +
Suppose that the user has a list of persons. The birthday parameters will be empty if the user has not modified the persons yet.
The user then adds the birthday through the BirthdayCommand : " `birthday 2 b/20/07/1994` "  where he adds the birthday parameter of the 2nd person in the list. +

After adding the birthday parameters of contacts, the user can choose to sort the contact list according to either their ages or birthdays or leave it as it is. +
The following sequence diagram shows how the birthday operation works:

===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Adding Birthday parameter +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add birthday parameter separately after person object is created. +
**Pros:** Lesser parameters to add while creating person class and easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Slower for users to add in all the parameters +
**Alternative 2:**  Add birthday parameter during the creation of person object. +
**Pros:** Faster for users to add in all the parameters. +
**Cons:** More parameters to add while creating person class and harder to implement. +

=== Enhancement Added : Different types of Find command
==== External Behaviour
===== Locating persons by emails: `findEmail`

Finds persons whose emails is same as the keyword. +
Format: `findEmail KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* Only the email is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `johnny` will not match `johnny@example.con`
* Multiple emails can be searched at one time.
****

Examples:

* `findEmail alex@example.com` +
Returns person with the email `alex@example.com`
* `findEmail alex@example.com jamie@example.com` +
Returns person with emails `alex@example.com` , `jamie@example.com`

==== Locating persons by emails: `findPhone`

Finds persons whose phone is same as the keyword. +
Format: `findPhone KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* Only the numbers is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `9567` will not match `95678432`
* Multiple phone numbers can be searched at one time.
****

Examples:

* `findPhone 86564385` +
Returns person with the phone number `96564385`
* `findPhone 87655678 98435670` +
Returns person with numbers `87655678` , `98435670`

==== Locating reminders by task names: `findReminder`

Finds reminderss whose task names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findReminder KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `proposals` will match `Proposals`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Proposal Submission` will match `Submission Proposal`
* Only the task name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `proposal` will not match `proposals`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Proposal Submission` will return `Proposal Draft`, `Project Submission`
****

Examples:

* `findReminder Proposal` +
Returns `Proposal` and `Proposal Submission`
* `findReminder Meeting Project Work` +
Returns any reminder having task names `Meeting`, `Proposal Submission`


==== Locating reminders by priority: `findPriority`

Finds reminders whose priority is same as the keyword. +
Format: `findPriority KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* Only Low / Medium / High is searched.
* The search is case sensitive. e.g `low` will not match `Low`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Hig` will not match `High`
* Multiple priorities can be searched at one time.
****

Examples:

* `findPriority High` +
Returns reminder with the priority `High`
* `findPriority Medium Low` +
Returns reminders with priority `Medium` , `Low`

==== Justification
It allows users to traverse through the lists and find contacts and reminders easily. +
For  `findPhone` and `findEmail` command, it is very handy when the user receives a call or email from an unknown person.
The user can use the number or email to search through the contact list using these commands to see if it belongs to any
one of his or her contact. +

Similarly, the user can use `findReminder` and `findPriority` command to search for reminders that he wants at any moment.

=== Enhancement Added : Different types of sort command
==== External Behaviour
===== Sorting all entries by age : `sortAge`

Sorts all entries in the person list by their age, from the oldest to youngest. +
Format: `sortAge`

===== Sorting all entries by birthday: `sortBirthday`

Sorts all entries in the person list by their birthday, from 1st Jan to 31st Dec. +
Format: `sortBirthday`

===== Sorting all entries by priority: `sortPriority`

Sorts all entries in the reminder list by their priority, from High to Medium to Low. +
Format: `sortPriority`

==== Justification
It offers more ways for users to look at the list. +
For example, `sortBirthday` enables users to view the list in the order of birthday,
allowing them to view upcoming birthday in a glance without searching through the entire list. +
The `sortAge` command allows users to view contacts by the order of their age, offering them a
new perspective of their contact list. +
On the other hand, `sortPriority` allows users to rearrange the list and view reminders
that have a high priority at the top.

=== Enhancement Added : Different types of sort command
==== External Behaviour
==== Listing all reminders : `listReminder`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book. +
Format: `listReminder`

==== Justification
It allows users to see all the reminders at a time after they are done searching for specific reminders. +
For example, a user may search for a specific reminder. It will bring them to the screen with only the reminder. To
bring them back to the list of all reminders, a `listReminder` command is needed.
