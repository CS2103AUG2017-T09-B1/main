== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
Gentleman's Guide is a desktop address book application modified from the Address Book - Level 4 to store person contacts and reminders.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/cqhchan.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/cqhchan.md[Test code]]

*Purpose of portfolio*: This portfolio is written to reflect the contributions made by the author to the Gentleman's Guide.
It shows how all the features implemented by the author work.

=== Enhancement Added : Private Database System
==== External Behaviour
===== Create Account Function `create`

==== External Behaviour
*Start of Extract[from: Developers Guide]*

===== Login Function `login`

The Login function work by using many different components. To facilitated its implementation there is a `LoginCommand` inside the `LogicManager` and `AddressBook Parser`. The `LoginCommand` works by taking the input and checking it with a database of accounts. If the inputs are verified, it will call upon the `UI` to restart the addressbook application with the new filepath.

The process of how the feature functions and what would happen is as follows:

_Figure 4.2.1 : Interactions in the Login Command._



As it can be seen, when the `logincommand` is called, if the credentials are correct, it would call on the `UiManager` to restart the application with the user database and model. The `Restart()` method created new user configs, preferences and storage according to the username. It then called on the current `Mainwindow` to close and closes the `primarystage` that the current `Mainwindow` is using. From there, it will call on the `UiManager` to initialise with the user `logic`, user `storage`, user `preferences` and user `config`.

The User can choose to Create an account if he does not already have one, but he will not be able to access the other users database.

Similiarly, the user can choose to implement the `logoutcommand` which would call on the `restart()` method with the parememter addressbook. The application would then restart and load the public addressbook.

===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `LoginFunction` +
**Alternative 1:** Create a whole new `LoginFunction` interface, with its own GUI etc +
**Pros:** `LoginFunction will have seperate Userprofile and database. It would be a more versatile application +
**Cons:** Diffiult to implement and even harder to test +
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement a `LoginCommand` function at the `CommandBox` +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. Achieves the basic functions of security +
**Cons:** Doesnt look as good.
