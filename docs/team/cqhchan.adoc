*Portfolio*: This portfolio is a summary of the work that I contributed to the Gentleman's Guide and a brief explanation
of the functions and implementations of those enhancements.

== Enhancement Added : Private Database System
=== External Behaviour
#Start of extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag = create]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag = login]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag = logout]

#End of extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Justification

Privacy is a integral part of daily life. By adding a simple password system. One can prevent majority of unauthorised access
by snooping eyes. This also allows the user a piece of mind that his private database cannot be recklessly and easily accessed by others.

=== Private Database Implementation


#Start of extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag = PrivateDatabase]

#End of extract [from: Developer Guide]#



== Enhancement Added : Select Reminder

=== External Behaviour
#Start of extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag = selectReminder]


#End of extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Justification

As the user may include long messages and the reminder card is unable to view the entire message due to space constrains,
thus selecting the reminder allows for easy viewing of the reminder.

=== Select Reminder Function `selectreminder`

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag = selectReminder]

== Enhancement Proposed
