== Project: Gentleman's Guide
Gentleman's Guide is a desktop contact book application modified from the Address Book - Level 4, created by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU team].
It is designed to support business-(gentle)men in their busy work life by providing them with an effective and efficient way of managing their contacts.
Furthermore, it helps them keep track of various tasks and reminds them about the upcoming deadlines.
The interaction between user and Gentlemanâ€™s Guide is mostly done through a Command Line Interface (CLI). +
This application is written in Java, and its Graphical User Interface (GUI) is created with JavaFX.

*About Project Portfolio*: This project portfolio summarizes all enhancements that I have added to Gentleman's Guide, including

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/duyson98.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/duyson98.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Retrieve command, Tag/Untag/Retag commands, View command

==== Justification

`tag` and `retrieve` commands help you organize your address book by putting tags to contacts
and quickly get all contacts that have been assigned with a certain tag.

`untag` and `retag` commands allow you to remove the tags that are no longer needed and modify the existing tags
to reflect the changes in your relationship with the contact owners.

more fields according to their preferences. They can also choose which fields to display on the person card
and if they wish to see all details of the contact, they can use view command to open the contact profile.
