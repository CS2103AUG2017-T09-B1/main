==== Justification

`tag` and `retrieve` commands help you organize your address book by putting tags to contacts
and quickly get all contacts that have been assigned with a certain tag.

`untag` and `retag` commands allow you to remove the tags that are no longer needed and modify the existing tags
to reflect the changes in your relationship with the contact owners.
